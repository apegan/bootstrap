Hi friend, I'm Alisha 一心 (she/hers)，a queer mixed-race Chinese & white designer, engineer,
builder, and artist. I live at the intersection of climate justice,
data analysis, and community building. After attending college at Wellesley and Olin,
I began working on collaborative initiatives in Boston and California around
renewable energy, energy conservation, and climate resilience. Collecting,
analyzing, and visualizing data has always been a key approach to addressing these efforts.

Fun fact, I was raised in a Buddhist monastery in Northern California,
which highly influenced my perspective on climate work.

Values:
1) Systems thinking: stepping back and learning to take a "Crude Look At the Whole"
2) Biomimicry: learn from the creative solutions nature has engineered for 3.8 billion years
3) Equity: develop actions that recognize and heal from historical harm and prioritize principles of Just Transition
4) Design thinking: engage, learn, and iterate from the knowledge concentrated in the community
5) Respect, Humor, and Humility: perspectives needed to do everything above

I currently work at Grid Alternatives supporting tribal governments obtain solar
and battery systems. I live in Ukiah, CA and like to bake desserts, ride bikes,
dance in the kitchen, and  analyze the cast dynamics of the Bachelorette.
