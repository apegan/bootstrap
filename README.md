# [Alisha Pegan's Website. Template based from -> Start Bootstrap - Clean Blog](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/clean-blog/)

Used the Clean Blog theme from startbootstrap.com to build a portfolio website. Linked to alishapegan.com. This is the first website I've built, so I'm quite pleased with myself. 

The main page is index.html. The other pages include analysis, community, and builds. Subpages sit under each corresponding folder. Images for all the pages sit in "img" folder. Styling is located in css--> clean-blog.css.
